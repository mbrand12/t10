:enter: >
  I enter a simple room by all accounts. With a bed, chair and desk. Yet for
  all the loneliness a room like this should exude, it actually feels peaceful.
:enter_visited: >
  I am back in the plain and peaceful room.
:look_nothing: >
  With no idea what to look at I decide to look at everything. Standing with my
  back to the door to the left of me is a bed, a few paces in front of me a
  desk with a chair. The room itself seems a little bit narrower than it should
  be, but a higher ceiling compensates.
:look_to_left: >
  To the left of me is a bed.
:look_to_right: >
  To the right of me is a wall.
:look_ahead: >
  A few paces in front of me there are a desk and a chair.
:look_origin: >
  Behind me there is a door.
:look_wall: >
  It is made from the bricks similar to that on the outside of the dungeon but
  smaller.
:look_ceiling: >
  I gaze up and see the ceiling it is higher but I can still see every brick.
:look_brick: >
  They all look same to me...
:look_door: >
  A simple door, like pretty much everything here. The only thing not fitting
  this room is a crest above the door.
:look_crest: >
  A %{crest} crest.
:look_bed: >
  A fairy simple one person bed. Looks well maintained and clean.
:look_chair: >
  A common wooden chair with no padding, it is a type of chair more used for
  work than resting.
:look_desk: >
  A well used work desk, probably older than anything in this room, it has no
  drawers. A neat pile of papers on one end and an inkwell. A candle on the
  desk illuminates the whole room faintly.
:look_desk_after: >
  On the desk now, right where the meal was, is a paper from the pile. In the
  middle of it, with a beautiful cursive handwriting reads:

  "Please do not extinguish the light again."

  Shortly after I have read it, the ink slowly disappears and instead of the
  dot at the end of the note I find a shiny piece.
:look_papers: >
  A neat stack of papers, not really useful.
:look_inkwell: >
  An inkwell, it is empty.
:look_candle: >
  A candle that looks like it is not made of wax, even though I can see the fire
  it seems like no wax is being melt. The candleholder looks like it is a part
  of the desk with no way to remove it.
:look_candleholder: >
  It has no specific markings on it, it is a simple candleholder.
:look_meal: >
  My stomach decides to remind me that I haven't had any food in quite a while.
  In fact, I don't really remember when was the last time I have ate a proper
  meal whatever that may be. Pity that there is no food here.
:look_meal_appeared: >
  A meal! A real meal! Should I eat it? Who knows when I will have the next one
  just appear in front of me. I can't seem to get my gaze of it, everything else
  seems not really interesting right now.
:look_meal_eaten: >
  It was just a dream... however I feel satiated, was it a dream then?
:touch_nothing: >
  With nothing to touch, I touch my nose.... still there.
:touch_nothing_10th: >
  With nothing to touch, I touch my nose, then I pick my nose for a while
  while a ponder what to do next.
:touch_door: >
  A door made of wood, nothing special, just a door.
:touch_crest: >
  I drag the chair do the door, get on the chair so that the crest is in front
  of me and touch it. It is made from the same material as the wall, and seems
  as immovable as one.
:touch_wall: >
  It feels warm.
:touch_ceiling: >
  Even if I climbed on the chair I would not be able to touch it.
:touch_brick: >
  I touch as many bricks as I can out of boredom in hope that this room will
  yield some secret passages but none appear.
:touch_bed: >
  Firm and relatively unused, it seems that nobody rested in it for awhile.
:touch_chair: >
  A chair made from wood, thankfully not fixed to the floor. Feels more
  comfortable than it looks, tough the only way to be sure it so sit on it.
:touch_desk: >
  A wooden table, its surface is smooth with just a little roughness.
:touch_papers: >
  Rather not... paper cuts are a real danger.
:touch_inkwell: >
  A inkwell not made of wood but still immovable. I dip my finger in it and
  feel like there is some ink left. Not knowing where to wipe it, I wipe my
  finger on the top of the pile of papers, smugging it all over. I made a mess
  out of, however after a little while the ink disappears. An invisible ink?
  Maybe I should stop touching things.
:touch_candle: >
  I very carefully touch the candle, it feels like it is made out of wax, yet
  none drips down.
:touch_candleholder: >
  Made from the same material as the inkwell, therefore not wood. I thought
  of truing to force both candle or the candleholder out, but think better of it
  as it seems that it is my only source of light.
:touch_meal_appeared: >
  I would just rather eat the food...
:sit_nothing: >
  Where should I sit?
:sit_no: >
  No I will not.
:sit_chair: >
  I sit on the chair and to my surprise it is comfortable. I look idly at the
  light of the candle and time passes. Amused by the light of the candle I
  begin to very gently blow air in its direction and look around the room as
  the light plays trick and moves the shadows around.

  The dust rises up from the desk and I sneeze at the candle, however the light
  is not extinguished and since I have no way of relighting it I decide to stop
  doing that and just continue to appreciate the candlelight.

  What stirs me from my daze is the smell of the food right in front of me on
  the table!
:sit_bed: >
  I sit on the bed and contemplate sleeping but the hunger I feel and have been
  feeling for a while make me restless so I decide against it.
:sit_desk: >
  That would be just rude.
:sit_meal_appeared: >
  I am already sitting, with no intention of moving for now.
:sit_overstayed: >
  I feel like I have overstayed my welcome here, so I decide against sitting.
:eat_nothing: >
  What should I eat? Is there even something edible here?
:eat_no: >
  I am not that hungry and even if I was I would not eat that.
:eat_meal: >
  I whish there was a meal to eat.
:eat_meal_appeared: >
  It just melts perfectly in my mouth, the flavor indescribable. It is like
  the when like tasting something you will always like to eat for the very
  firs time, when the sensation is completely new for the senses.

  With every bite I... awake.
  It was a dream.

  I rise from the bed, feeling recovered just by a little. I stretch and turn,
  even though I was somewhat disappointed that it was a dream I feel better. I
  notice something different about the desk.
:extinguish_nothing: >
  What should I extinguish?
:extinguish_candle: >
  Why would I extinguish my only light source in this room? There are no
  windows in this room, and relying on whatever light to come from the opened
  door of this room just invites more trouble.
:extinguish_candle_end: >
  Since I am done with this room, somewhat out of spite for the meal that never
  was (although I did get a nice rest) I extinguish the candle. Since the room
  is small and I know where the door is I go to the ex

  Behind me.

  A gentle voice says:.

  "You should not have done that."

  I scream.
:extinguish_no: >
  Nothing is on fire, if you don't count the candle.
:obtained_shiny: >
  I look around the room, wondering about the note but I feel that for the most
  part my respite in this room has come to an end and that it is the time for me
  to explore other parts and rooms of this dungeon.
