  The first thing I feel, as I open the door, is the almost overwhelming
  metallic taste, and while the door is of the standard size for this dungeon,
  the room is much larger with the ceiling taller than... the giant armored
  figure on the other side of the room.

  I stand very still in the doorway for a while waiting for the figure to show
  any signs or disapproval of my trespassing in its domain. A thought about
  returning to a relative safety of the previous room occurs to me more than
  once.

  Finally, I decide to venture in, the door behind me closes suddenly and I
  rush back to open them. And, surprisingly, the door opens. I try it a few
  more times just to be sure and with some confidence stand a few more steps
  away from the door, always keeping in sight the figure, which honestly is not
  a hard task considering it size.
:enter_visited: >
  I am back in the room with the giant armored figure.
:enter_battle_done: >
  The door will not open because a big part of the defeted giant blocks it,
  knowing that I have no way of proceeding forward I return to the previous
  room.
:look_nothing: >
  With nothing specific to look at, I take in the scene. In front of me there is
  a giant armor, in the center of the room there is a black square pedestal.
:look_armor: >
  It is gigantic, on closer inspection it seems that it is just some armor for
  a gigantic being rather than a giant itself, thankfully. I would rather keep
  my distance even so.  But even this far I can see that much work on detail
  has been spent on detailed but unreadable inscriptions. The armor itself is
  gray adorned with golden stripes where one part of the armor covers another
  one.
:look_pedestal: >
  It is not really square, it is more of a rectangular cuboid... anyway it is
  perfectly shaped with a black surface that seems to devour the light around
  it. Only odd thing is a shiny peace on top of it. Considering what I have
  seen up to this point an ominous rectangular cuboid with an obvious shiny on
  top of it doesn't really count as odd.
:look_shiny: >
  It is a shiny piece.
:look_door: >
  A only door out from this place adorned by two stone pillars, made from the
  similar material as the surrounding walls. Slightly above the door a rather old
  %{crest} crest with no remarkable features.
:look_crest: >
  A %{crest} crest, nothing special about it.
:look_wall: >
  The wall of this, if I can even call it, room is covered by huge blocks not
  much different from those outside of the dungeon.
:look_pillar: >
  Since my attention has been fixated on the giant armor I didn't really notice
  another giant armor this one much older and made from stone, more like a giant
  statue really. Which is probably why I have mistook his legs for simple
  pillars.
:look_stone: >
  This side of the room is darker than the one where the giant armor is so
  aside from its legs I can see only vague shape that resembles the other giant
  armor.  This giant however in his hands has what it seems to be a sword and a
  shield. I can only guess this from the basic outline that the shape makes.
:touch_nothing: >
  With nothing specific to touch I touch my left hand.
:touch_armor: >
  Risking way too much I approach the giant armored figure and touch it. It is
  cold to the touch and the air feels different around it. I also hear a very
  low hum deep inside. It also doesn't seem hollow yet I can't feel any
  presence inside.
:touch_pedestal: >
  Usually when one touches or taps on something it gives some sort of response
  mostly trough either sound or some sort of vibration. This thing gives none,
  it is as if it swallows everything around it.
:touch_shiny: >
  I touch the shiny. It feels ordinary almost plain.
:touch_door: >
  Like most doors in this dungeon, nothing really out of the ordinary.
:touch_crest: >
  Can't really reach it, but even if I could I doubt it would be of use.
:touch_wall: >
  The wall here looks as reinforced as the one outside of the dungeon.
:touch_pillar: >
  It displays the same warmth as the walls.
:touch_stone: >
  Where the other giant armor is cold to the touch this one is warm. I can feel
  some sort of presence within, like I instinctively know there is something
  there but have no way of proving it.
:obtained_shiny: >
  A room with a shiny in the middle, whatever can go wrong?

  Well several things actually.

  First, the room lights up, allowing me to see more of it, the pedestal
  decides that it doesn't want to be here for whats to come so it descends into
  the floor disappearing completely. It would be nice if I could do that just
  about now.

  Second, the giant armor comes to life and kneels placing its left hand on the
  floor near me palm facing up, its right arm on the right knee, looking like
  knight bowing to his lord, at any other situation I would be impressed and
  deeply moved by this.

  Third, the other stone armor giant comes to life at the same time, voicing
  displeasure, probably, about my recent action. Its eyes glowing red now
  definitely fixated on me. I chuckle a little, amused and terrified by the
  current situation.
:go_nothing: >
  Where should I?
:go_pedestal: >
  I stay in the center of the room, hoping that I will also sink into the
  ground and go somewhere else. But it seems that you have to be of the black
  lifeless cuboid disposition to do that.

  Instead I become a red stain.
:go_door: >
  I rush towards the door in hopes that the stone giant is not fast enough to
  notice and horribly deal with me.

  Stone giant is fast enough.

  And horribly deals with me.
:go_pillar: >
  The stone giant probably can't stomp me if I am close to his legs.

  I was wrong.
:go_stone: >
  In the act of desperation and lack of sanity I face the stone giant face to
  foot.

  Foot wins.
