:enter: >
  I enter a room with a opposite wall being so close to the door that I can
  hardly turn around. On the wall before me there is a hole.
:enter_visited: >
  I am back at the room with the uncomfortably close wall.
:look_nothing: >
  This is a small room, if it is a room at all.
:look_to_left: >
  To the left of me is a wall. I can hardly turn to face it.
:look_to_right: >
  To the right of me is a wall, I can hardly turn to face it.
:look_ahead: >
  In front of me is a wall with a hole in the center of it in the shape of
  something familiar.
:look_origin: >
  The is a door to my back.
:look_door: >
  Nothing special about the door nor the the old %{crest} crest above it.
:look_crest: >
  An old %{crest} shaped crest.
:look_wall: >
  The wall on the sides in pretty much the typical wall in here. The wall in
  front of me is somewhat different but not by much, bar the hole in the middle
  of it.
:look_hole: >
  The shape of this hole seems very familiar to me...
:touch_nothing: >
  With nothing to touch the back of my neck.
:touch_wall: >
  The walls are warm to the touch, the one in front of me is slightly colder.
:touch_hole: >
  I can feel some markings on the edges of the hole but I can't read them.
:used_amulet: >
  As I place the amulet in the center hole of a big wall. As I do that lines of
  blue light rush trough the cracks and the wall disappears, introducing me to
  a clear blue sky and a path in front of me, which while long at least is full
  of life and hope.
