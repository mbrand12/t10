  I always find myself here, looking at this gate, not remembering anything
  about myself. I do remember how to look at the things, touch and open things,
  just to name a few. There is even, left, right, and behind sometimes for me
  to look at. But in the end just enough to know that I know nothing at all,
  about this place and about myself I feel static, and will move only with
  purpose.
:enter_visited: >
  The gate's door won't open no matter how much I push, pull or intend to pass.
  As far as it is concerned, its purpose has been fulfilled, and it has decided
  to spend the rest of its days in blissful stillness. I return to the previous
  room, with the understanding that if I want to get out of here I need to find
  another way.
:look_gate: >
  The gate, like the whole wall, is bland, existing there just to exist. Like a
  choice so obvious that it needs no more for it to be than it already is. On
  to of its arch, however, there is a crest, a %{crest} shaped crest.
:look_crest: >
  A %{crest} shaped crest matches its surroundings, faded out like most things
  that once where impressive but with time they become just a reminder of a
  former glory. As I stared at it, for just a moment, the %{crest} stared back.
:look_wall: >
  To both my left and my right spans a wall so tall, or just tall enough, that
  I am unable to determine weather it is just a wall or this gate or a wall of
  some dungeon as well. Seemingly infinite, on both sides, I can't tell where
  the wall ends robbing me of the choice to simply go around it.
:look_path: >
  Behind me a path. A gray path, only but a darker shade of the land
  surrounding it, which in itself is desolate. The whole scene is so impossibly
  flat that it seems like the path leads nowhere and just melts in the distance
  with the surrounding gloom.
:look_nothing: >
  With nothing specific to look at, I look around taking in the dull atmosphere
  as I ponder my next decision.
:touch_wall: >
  The wall is warm to the touch, it is also not possible for me to climb it.
:touch_crest: >
  I am unable to reach it.
:touch_path: >
  I poke the ground, it decides to do nothing about it.
:touch_gate: >
  The gate, or more precisely the door, is made of wood, ancient but not worn
  out. Up my attempt to touch the door, it gently opens being just out of my
  reach. Warm and pleasant air envelopes me, luring me inside.
:touch_open_gate: >
  The door is opened, touching it would mean entering so I decide against
  touching the door.
:touch_nothing: >
  With no idea on what to poke or touch, I tap myself just to confirm that this
  isn't a dream. It isn't, now I can only hope it isn't a nightmare as well.
:open_gate: >
  There is no handle, but the door opens silently as if it knows my intention,
  I see nothing but vague shapes inside.
:open_opened_gate: >
  The door of the gate is already open.
:open_nothing: >
  Other than the gate door there is really nothing here to open.
:enter_gate: >
  As I go in closely to take look of what is inside. The door swiftly, but
  gently considering its weight, closes and pushes me into the hallway.

  The gentleness of the door still brings me pain, and with it some velocity.
  So as I stumble forward, I place my hand on a cold round stone on the
  pedestal and instantly feel better, like I can take %{hero_max_hp_m1} hits
  but the next one would be the end of me.

  The round stone, a symbol of impermanence upon it, cracked and lost its glow.
  And sound of the orb cracking and the door closing a much deeper echo of
  finality shakes the dungeon as if an uncertainty has become a certainty,
  never to change as long as I am in here, wherever here is.
:enter_path: >
  I know not what will venturing in this dungeon bring me, it might be a
  blessing or a fate even worse than this one now. So I chose the known rather
  than unknown and walk on the path which direction and obstacles I can clearly
  see, and there are none. A path which beginning and the end I know very well.
  A path which is rich as my memories, I will learn nothing new.

  I walk so long that time loses meaning, everything does. After some time,
  eons perhaps, I look left and right and see nothing but the path, and after a
  while nothing but the path remains.
:enter_nothing: >
  I can't enter it.
