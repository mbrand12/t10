  I run to the left lowered hand of the giant armor and climb on it. The giant
  armor raises with me in its hand, then steam starts to blow from its chest
  piece and it opens revealing a cabin of sorts containing one, I can only
  guess, chair.

  Leaving me with no choice the armor practically dumps me in the cabin and the
  chest piece closes, leaving me in total darkness, but not for long.

  An eerie lights shines in the small cabin and I sit on the chair since there
  is little space to do anything else. In front of me a sort of a mirror
  appears that shows me the stone giant with its sword and shield poised to
  attack.

  I feel movement as the giant armor reaches to its back and wields a giant
  halberd.

  In front of me an unknown mechanism raises a box filled with vials, various
  switches and pressure plates. A voice then speaks:

  "Control panel on-line, relinquishing command to the pilot."

  Guessing that I am this Pilot I try to do something to command this big armor
  to move and start interacting with the box, however nothing happens. As on cue
  the voice announces:

  "Pilot skill level Cadet::Beginner. Activating voice command mode".
:do_something_ft: >
  "Well do something!", I shout at the voice in frustration as I have no idea
  what commands should I utter. And in response I get:

  " Selecting random command. Command: %{command} "
:do_something: >
  " Selecting random command. Command: %{command} ", the voice announces with a
  hint of pride.
:attack_nothing: >
  The voice says: "Insufficient data, please provide direction or type as well."
:attack_attH_attH: >
  The stone giant swings its sword horizontally making use of the shield to
  deflect the attacks coming from the shield side, however the giant armor's
  attack comes from the opposite side in a wide horizontal arc and hits the
  giant's arm effectively nullifying the stone giant's attack and dealing
  damage as well.
:attack_attH_attV: >
  In the anticipation of a vertical attack the stone giant's shield rises while
  a fast upwards vertical swing comes from below, both attacks land on their
  mark as the halberd hits horizontally.
:attack_attH_attT: >
  Even with the shield raised up in the anticipation of a vertical attack the
  giant armor's halberd comes to slow in its horizontal arc. The stone giant's
  thrust attack deals damage and nullifies the giant armor's attack.
:attack_attH_shield: >
  I decide to tackle the giant's shield stance with a horizontal attack. The
  giant expertly catches the attack on the shield and responds with a
  horizontal attack of its own, armor takes critical damage.
:attack_attV_attH: >
  The giant armor lifts its halberd and it brings it down with considerable
  force hitting the stone giant in the head just as the stone giant's sword
  following it horizontal arc hits the giant armor in the body shaking the
  cabin I am in.  Both sides suffer damage.
:attack_attV_attV: >
  A downward vertical attack is deflected and then punished by the stone giant's
  upward vertical attack.
:attack_attV_attT: >
  A powerful downward smash is effortlessly blocked by the stone giant's thrust
  maneuver, involving raising the shield about its head and performing a thrust
  attack.
:attack_attV_shield: >
  I order the armor to attack vertically hoping to catch the opponent unawares
  but the giant seems to be waiting for it raises the shield and responds with
  a vicious upward swing damaging the armor.
:attack_attT_attH: >
  A thrust attack while fast is anticipated by stone giant's horizontal attack
  and punished.
:attack_attT_attV: >
  A halberd's thrust attack proves ineffective as it is met and deflected by
  the shield and followed by a upward vertical attack by the stone giant.
:attack_attT_attT: >
  Making the use of its long reach the giant armor's trust attack out ranges
  both the shield in position to receive a vertical attack and the thrust
  attack that follows it dealing critical damage to the stone giant.
:attack_attT_shield: >
  A thrust attack is repelled effortlessly and a same thrust attack from the
  giant come as a response.
:attack_kick_att: >
  I issue a kick attack command only to find it useless against the giants own
  attack, the armor receives damage for my mistake.
:attack_kick_shield: >
  The giant might have expected a well placed halberd attack to defend against
  but instead it receives a full weight of the kick placed squarely in the
  center of the shield which in turn violently crashes against the giant
  damaging it.
:defend_nothing: >
  The voice says "Insufficient data, please provide direction as well."
:defend_defH_attH: >
  As the stone giant attacks the giant armor assumes a defensive stance placing
  the halberd horizontally in anticipation of a vertical attack but the attack
  that comes is horizontal as well and it damages the armor.
:defend_defH_attV: >
  Unleashing a vicious upwards swing the stone giant is successfully parried by
  the giant armor's horizontal defensive stance. In retaliation the giant armor
  performs a powerful thrust heavily damaging the stone giant.
:defend_defH_attT: >
  Defensive attempts by the giant armor are rendered futile as the stone giant
  performs a trust attack.
:defend_defV_attH: >
  In expectation of the horizontal attack by the stone giant I order the giant
  armor to defend vertically. The giant armor places the halberd vertically with
  the blade down, parries the horizontal attack by the stone giant and reposts
  an upwards swing heavily damaging the stone giant.
:defend_defV_attV: >
  The vertical defensive position assumed by the giant armor in order to block
  horizontal attack does nothing to stop the vertical upward swing from the
  stone armor.
:defend_defV_attT: >
  Defensive attempts by the giant armor are rendered futile as the stone giant
  performs a trust attack.
:defend_def_shield: >
  Both sides take up a defensive stance and stay like that for what would seem
  infinity. Seeing that no offensive action will come from the armor, giant
  poises to attack.
:shield_stance: >
  The giant now takes up a defensive stance with the shield directly in front.
:deploy_nothing: >
  "Insufficient data, please provide deployment type as well.", the voice says.
:deploy_depN_att: >
  The giant armor lowers its halberd form the battle stance and the voice
  announces:

  "Deploying repair nanomist", which seems to renew the giants armor a
  little and the mist itself seems to temporary stop the stone giants attempts
  at attacking in anyway.
:deploy_depN_shield: >
  While the stone giant recovers behind a shield I use the chance to order the
  giant armor to deploy the recovering mist, renewing the giants armor a little.
:attack_no_ap: >
  "Insufficient movement fluid, recommending defensive options to regain fluids"
  the voice announces.
:deploy_no_mp: >
  "Insufficient nano fluids" the voice announces.
:stone_no_ap: >
  The stone giant raises its shield and assumes a defensive stance.
:check_nothing: >
  What should I check?
:check_box_ft: >
  The box in front of me appears quite curious and probably risking utter
  destruction I start pressing plates and fiddling with knobs and levers to
  which the voice reacts:

  "Direct command denied for Cadet::Beginner please use voice commands instead."

  Somewhat disappointed about this I turn my attention to a total of four vials
  embedded in this command box each with a different color with numbered notches
  bellow, or in the case of the vertical vial on the side.

  Each vial has at least some fluid in it of a different color. The topmost
  horizontal one has a red fluid pointing to notch number %{hp} on the scale,
  the second has green fluid pointing to notch number %{ap} while the third,
  blue, one to the %{mp} number. All the vials are not full to their maximum
  capacity but the vertical vial seems to be completely empty bar the orange
  fluid somewhere around notch numbered zero.

  Something tells me that I should check this box frequently, maybe it will
  help me learn now this armor actually work, before the lumbering figure in
  front of me crushes me to a pulp
:check_box: >
  The red vial is at %{hp} number notch.

  The green vial is at %{ap} number notch.

  The blue vial is at %{mp} number notch.

  The orange vial is at %{sp} number notch.
:battle_lost: >
  With no fluid left in the red vial the giant armor falls on its knees. I feel
  a hollow sound as the stone giant victoriously kicks the armor to the ground.
  The voice calmly announces that the "hull has been breached" and as the stone
  giant's sole of the foot approaches the cabin becomes too small for me to
  exist in it as I am now.
:battle_won: >
  The lights from stone giants' eyes start to flicker and fade. The giant form,
  now without that mystic energy to keep it still starts slowly collapsing into
  a rubble.

  The table in front of me shifts a little revealing a golden plate of some
  sort with a glowing orange mirror in the middle of it. Seeing how it is
  practically offered to me I take it.
:battle_aftermath: >
  With a hint of pride the voice announces "Threat neutralized, entering
  recovery mode"  And with that being said the cabin finally opens, the armor
  grabs me surprisingly gently and places me on the floor and assumes the
  position it had before all this have started.

  Having my fill of this place I carefully move trough the rubble trying not to
  touch anything for the risk of it collapsing on me or the door. But as a what
  is seems a final act of defiance the part of the leg that still remained
  upright started collapsing just as I was near the door.

  Not wasting a moment I rushed trough the door and the door closed with a loud
  bang, announcing that it will not open anytime soon.
