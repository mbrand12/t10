:orb_cracked: >
  As I go trough the hallway, out of some ancient habit, I touch the round
  stone, now cracked, hoping that even in that state it might provide me with
  some blessing. It provides me with none.
:orb_heal: >
  As I go trough the hallway, out of habit, I touch the round stone, which
  emits a gentle glow, and my hopes of it restoring me come true. Feeling that
  I can take %{hit_points} more hits before I perish, I proceed. However, the
  orb suddenly cracks and the hallway becomes a darker place urging me to find
  whatever comfort I can in the room before me.
:orb_no_heal: >
  As I pass trough the hallway the faint light from the round orb grants me
  respite. I touch the orb and note how warm it is and turn my attention over
  to the next room, leaving the glowing orb as it casts my shadow upon the
  door.
