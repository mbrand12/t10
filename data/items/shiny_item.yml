  %{item_quantity} shiny pieces
:desc_short_qn: >
  %{item_quantity} shiny pieces. I feel like I should do something with them
  rather than having them just bunched up like this, might lose some by
  accident.
:desc_short: >
  A shiny piece. Precious for others, shiny for me.
:desc_long: >
  A small, but really shiny piece. Its glow is fainter now but still shiny
  enough that I can't look at it for long. It looks as a part of something
  bigger.
:desc_long_qn: >
  I happen to have %{item_quantity} of them.
