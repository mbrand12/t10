  About the size of my opened hand, this round amulet seems lighter than it
  should be. On one side it has an engraving of four animals. On the left there
  is a tiger ready to pounce on the dragon on the right, which lies coiled in
  wait. Above them a phoenix envelops them with its wings, while below them a
  turtle seems to be staring right at me. The other side seems hollow, probably
  something used to fit here.
:desc_combined: >
  Carefully, I place a shiny piece in one of the openings, each opening is just
  different enough that I can't place the piece anywhere as it each has a
  predetermined slot.
:desc_combined_qn: >
  Carefully, I place a %{q_or_q} shiny pieces in their appropriate slots. The
  engraving in the back becomes more and more iluminated with each peace.
